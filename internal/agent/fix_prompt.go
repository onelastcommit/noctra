- Address ONLY the feedback and CI failures listed above. Do not refactor unrelated code or pick up new work.
- If CI is failing, reproduce it locally (run the relevant tests / linter), fix the root cause, and re-run to confirm it passes.
- A human reviewer's request is an instruction, including one that agrees with another reviewer's finding ("good point, let's fix this"). Make the change. Push back only if it would break something or can't be done, and say why.
- If a bot's feedback is wrong or inapplicable, briefly say so and skip it — do not silently ignore it.
- Run the test suite and the linter (`+"`golangci-lint run`"+`, if configured) after your changes; fix anything you broke.
- If you cannot proceed because more context is needed, say BLOCKED: <reason> and stop.
- Do NOT create a new PR, push a new branch, or close the existing PR — Noctra handles that.

## When done

Wrap a short summary between %s and %s. Say what you addressed and how, and call out anything you deliberately skipped or pushed back on (with the reason) — this is posted back on the PR for the reviewer.

# ── Build stage ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Compile the static Noctra binary. CGO is disabled so the result runs on
# any Linux without libc surprises — and so the compiler can cross-compile.
#
# Pin the build stage to BUILDPLATFORM (the native builder arch) and let Go
# cross-compile to TARGETARCH. For a multi-arch build this keeps the Go
# toolchain running natively instead of emulating the compiler under QEMU for
# the non-native arch — much faster, with an identical static result.

# ── Runtime stage ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Noctra shells out to git (worktrees/clone), gh (PR creation), and a coding
# agent CLI (claude/codex/copilot, all via npm), so the runtime needs all of
# them. The node base supplies the agent runtime; git + gh on top.
# Node 22+ is required: @github/copilot lists Node.js 22 as its prerequisite but
# declares no `engines` field, so an older base installs cleanly yet fails at
# runtime. We pin Node 24 (current LTS), comfortably above that floor; claude/codex
# are happy on it too.

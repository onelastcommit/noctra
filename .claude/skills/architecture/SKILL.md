# Architecture & Contributing

Use this playbook before changing Noctra's core code. The invariants below are easy to violate in a plausible-looking patch; each has caused a real bug or regression.

## Package map (navigation aid)

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `cmd/noctra` | Entry point, subcommand dispatch, startup banner |
| `internal/config` | `.env` parser, validated `Config`, `DefaultConfigDir` |
| `internal/linear` | Linear GraphQL client (trigger queries, state/label mutations, comments, Telegram read queries) |
| `internal/repo` | Repo resolution (`ResolveDirect` / `Resolve`), clone-on-demand, worktree create/resume/cleanup, `BranchName` |
| `internal/agent` | Pluggable coding-agent backends, shared prompt builders, log_offset helpers, `BlockedLine`, `ExtractSummary` |
| `internal/review` | Optional Gemini second-model review gate |
| `internal/notify` | Optional Telegram notifier (fire-and-forget) |
| `internal/telegram` | Inbound Telegram listener (long-polling, command dispatch) |
| `internal/github` | Thin `gh` CLI wrapper (`ListNoctraPRs`, `GetPR`, `CheckLogs`) |
| `internal/ghauth` / `internal/ghauthcmd` | GitHub App mode: instance key, signed token-service client, device flow, git credential helper, `github login/logout/status` |
| `internal/state` | File-backed PR cursor store (`~/.noctra-state.json`) |
| `internal/watch` | Side-effect-free PR classifier (diffs feedback + CI against cursor) |
| `internal/pipeline` | Poll loop, worker pool, per-ticket lifecycle (`process.go`), PR-watch + iterate (`iterate.go`), Telegram commands (`commands.go`) |
| `internal/setup` | Interactive setup wizard |
| `internal/cleanup` | Cleanup subcommand (branches, worktrees, old logs) |
| `internal/service` | `install-service` subcommand (systemd unit rendering) |
| `internal/doctor` | Preflight checks (CLIs, auth, repo routing) |
| `internal/selfupdate` | In-place binary upgrade via GoReleaser archives |

## Invariant 1: the `log_offset` pattern

Agent logs append across attempts. `agent.OffsetBefore` records the file size *before* the agent runs; `agent.ReadAfter` reads only the new tail. `BlockedLine` and `HasRateLimit` operate on that tail.

**Rule:** never scan the full log file to detect failures. That re-detects failures from previous attempts and causes false positives (e.g. a ticket that was rate-limited on attempt 1 would be falsely detected as rate-limited on attempt 2 even when the agent succeeded).

**Where it lives:** `internal/agent/exec.go` (`OffsetBefore`, `ReadAfter`), consumed in `internal/pipeline/process.go` and `internal/pipeline/iterate.go`.

## Invariant 2: the `noctra/` branch-prefix guardrail

The auto-iterate watcher identifies its own PRs by the `noctra/<id>` branch prefix. `repo.BranchName` generates it; `github.ListNoctraPRs` filters on it; `watch` and `iterate` depend on it.

**Rules:**
- Keep `CreateWorktree` and `ResumeWorktree` on the same prefix or the watcher silently never finds its own PRs.
- Never create a `noctra/`-prefixed branch for manual work or agent-assisted PRs in this repo. The watcher will claim it and push conflicting follow-up commits.
- Use `fix/`, `feat/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, or `eng-<n>-<slug>` prefixes for non-Noctra branches.

## Invariant 3: backend-agnostic `internal/agent` split

Almost everything in `internal/agent` is shared across all backends (Claude, Codex, Copilot): prompt builders (`BuildPrompt`, `BuildFixPrompt`), `BlockedLine`, log_offset helpers, and `ExtractSummary`.

**Only two things differ per backend:**
1. **Invocation args** — `claudeArgs` / `codexArgs` / `copilotArgs`. All go through the shared `runCLI`.
2. **Rate-limit parsing** — `HasRateLimit` with per-backend regexes (`claudeRateLimitRe` / `codexRateLimitRe` / `copilotRateLimitRe`).

**Rule:** when adding shared agent logic, put it in the common code (`exec.go`, `prompt.go`). Only add to a backend-specific file (`claude.go`, `codex.go`, `copilot.go`) if the behaviour genuinely differs per backend. If adding a new backend, implement the `Backend` interface and add the name to `agent.New`.

## Invariant 4: cursor semantics

The PR-watch system tracks what feedback has been acted on via cursors in `internal/state`:

- **Comment/review cursors** are **timestamps** (naturally ordered). Conversation comments and inline review-thread comments share the comment cursor.
- **CI cursor** is keyed by **head commit SHA** (`LastCISHA`) — acted on once per commit. A fix push changes the SHA, making a fresh failure on the new commit eligible again.

**Rule:** don't change cursor types or comparison logic without understanding that timestamps work for comments (monotonically increasing) but not for CI (where the same SHA can have multiple check runs; what matters is "have we already acted on this SHA?").

## Invariant 5: pure functions for testability

Noctra follows a convention of extracting logic into **pure, side-effect-free functions** that are unit-tested independently from the I/O that calls them:

| Pure function | Package | What it does |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| `claudeArgs` / `codexArgs` / `copilotArgs` | `internal/agent` | Build CLI argument slices |
| `unitFile(exePath, pathEnv)` | `internal/service` | Render the systemd unit file |
| `completionScript(shell)` | `cmd/noctra` | Generate shell-completion scripts |
| `watch.diff` / `watch.actionable` | `internal/watch` | Classify PR changes, apply trusted-reviewer rules |
| `selfupdate.IsNewer` / `assetName` | `internal/selfupdate` | Version comparison, archive name selection |

**Rule:** when adding new logic, prefer extracting the decision/formatting into a pure function with table-driven tests, then call it from the I/O layer. This keeps tests fast and deterministic.

## Invariant 6: golangci-lint v2 syntax

The repo uses `.golangci.yml` with `version: "2"` syntax. This means:
- Linters are configured under `linters.default` and `linters.settings`, not the v1 `linters.enable` list.
- Formatters are under `formatters.enable` (e.g. `gofmt`), not mixed with linters.

**Rule:** if adding linter config, use v2 syntax. v1 keys will cause a parse error.

## Invariant 7: the codebase carries no comments

Source files hold **zero comments** — the only exception is a compiler/tooling directive (`//go:embed`,
`//go:build`, `//nolint`, `// Code generated`). Do not reintroduce explanatory comments, doc comments on
exported symbols included. Names and structure carry the *what*; this file and `CLAUDE.md` carry the *why*.

The non-obvious facts that previously lived in comments, kept here so removing them lost nothing:

| Where | Invariant |
|---|---|
| `repo/worktree.go` | Worktree mutations serialize per clone via `lockRepo` — concurrent `git worktree add` on one clone collides on the `.git/config` lock. Remove the worktree **before** the branch: git won't delete a branch still checked out, and a leftover branch fails `worktree add -b`. |
| `repo/worktree.go` | Ticket dispatch uses `CreateOrResumeWorktree`, never `CreateWorktree` directly: a run that pushed its branch but died before `gh pr create` leaves an orphaned remote branch, and re-branching from main produces a non-descendant origin rejects as non-fast-forward. |
| `repo/worktree.go` | `clearWorktreePath` falls back to `os.RemoveAll` + `git worktree prune` when `worktree remove` fails. A directory git no longer tracks as a worktree (e.g. a half-deleted `node_modules` left by an interrupted cleanup) makes `worktree remove` a no-op and `worktree add` fail with "already exists" — forever, since nothing else deletes it. |
| `pipeline/sweep_branch.go` | Sweep branch names are fixed per repo+task, so they are reused across runs. A sweep skips while its previous PR is still open (a fresh run would collide with it), and otherwise pushes with `--force-with-lease` pinned to the SHA `ls-remote` just reported: the only remote branch left at that point belongs to a merged or closed PR, and a fresh branch from main is never its descendant. |
| `pipeline/iterate.go` | Every failure path must record the iteration before returning, or the cursor never advances and the same feedback loops forever. Two deliberate exceptions: infra failures (timeout / rate-limit) don't increment — they weren't real attempts — and a shutdown cancellation isn't recorded at all, since it would bump the count and could fire the cap warning. |
| `lessons/lessons.go` | Lessons come only from the PR branch's own (`--first-parent`, `--no-merges`) commits after `LastPushedSHA` that are neither `[bot]`-authored nor Noctra's. Noctra commits under the host's git identity, so it is recognised by the commit-body lines `Implemented by Noctra` / `Follow-up commit by Noctra` / `Autonomous maintenance by Noctra` (`noctraCommitRe`) — reword those in `pipeline` and Noctra starts learning from itself. A plain `git diff` also swept in everything an "Update branch" merge pulled from main, which is how feature descriptions ended up stored as conventions. |
| `pipeline/iterate.go` | Push whenever the branch is ahead, not just when the worktree is dirty: the agent sometimes self-commits, and gating on dirtiness alone silently drops those commits (ENG-182). |
| `pipeline/plan.go` | `hasPendingPlan` takes `p.mu` itself — callers must **not** already hold it. |
| `pipeline/sweep.go` | A manual sweep deliberately skips `MarkSwept` so an ad-hoc run never shifts the scheduled cadence. |
| `pipeline/sweep.go` | Both abort paths (timeout, token cap) **do** record the cooldown. A task that aborts will abort again identically, so skipping it would re-burn the full ceiling every cycle; `/sweep --force` is the escape hatch. Their `run_history` status is `aborted`, not `failed` — the run was healthy, we killed it. |
| `pipeline/sweep.go` | Outcome notifications send on `context.WithoutCancel(ctx)`: `markDone` cancels the task context the instant `processSweepTask` returns, and `notifier.Send` is fire-and-forget, so a plain `ctx` races with its own cancellation. |
| `agent/claude.go` | `runCapped` learns the real cost only from the terminal `result` event, which never arrives when the cap fires `cancel()`. It accumulates the per-turn usage breakdown plus the model name while streaming and estimates from `PricesForModel` whenever `result` is missing — otherwise aborted runs record `$0.00` and the daily cost cap never sees them. |
| `sweep/task_*.go` | A task that hits the token ceiling is non-converging, not under-provisioned — every aborted run consumed exactly its ceiling at 2M, 5M and 8M, while every productive one finished under 1M. Any task that verifies in a loop must cap both its work and its full-suite runs in the prompt, and be told to ship what is already green. |
| `notify/discord.go` | `allowed_mentions.parse` must be a **non-nil** empty slice so it marshals to `[]` and not `null`; `null` re-enables `@everyone`/`@here` parsing on untrusted ticket text. |
| `notify/telegram.go` | `EscapeMarkdown` covers Telegram's strict legacy-Markdown chars. Apply it to dynamic values only, leaving the template's own `*bold*` alone — an unescaped `snake_case` title returns 400 and the notification vanishes (PR #52). |
| `linear/types.go` | The self-comment filter still matches the pre-rename `**Nightshift` prefix (ENG-204 tickets carry it). Classify by the **first non-empty line** only: a leading `>` quote is a human quoting our notice, never a system comment. |
| `github/types.go` | `RepoURL` is the discovering clone's remote URL, not gh JSON, and preserves its scheme — synthesizing HTTPS from `owner/name` breaks auto-iterate on SSH-only private repos. |
| `github/client.go` | Truncation skips UTF-8 continuation bytes (top bits `10`) so a log slice never cuts mid-rune. |
| `github/client.go` | Every `Repo:` directive ref goes through `NormalizeRepoRef` before parsing: Linear rewrites a bare URL in project content into `[url](<url>)` on save, and the raw markdown reaches `ExtractOwnerRepo` as the ref. Unwrapped, a GitHub link errors as "no repo mapping" and a non-GitHub link silently resolves to `github.com/<owner>/<name>`. |
| `telegram/listener.go` | The HTTP client timeout must exceed `pollTimeout`, or every long-poll `getUpdates` aborts client-side. |
| `state/state.go` | `Update`'s callback runs under the store lock — never call back into the `Store` from it. `OpenMigrating` imports the legacy JSON only when the DB is newly created; an existing DB is never clobbered. |
| `agent/log.go` | `usageFooterRe` is anchored to end-of-string so it never eats a mid-summary mention of token usage. |
| `agent/copilot.go` | Bridge only tokens Copilot accepts (`gho_` / `github_pat_`). It rejects classic `ghp_` PATs and reads the env token before its own store, so injecting one breaks an otherwise-valid `copilot /login`. |
| `agent/antigravity.go` | `agy`'s `--print` is a **string** flag whose value *is* the prompt: the auto-approve flag must precede it and the prompt must be the final token, or `--print` swallows the next flag. |
| `dashboard/dashboard.go` | `/fonts/` stays unauthenticated: `@font-face` `url()` subrequests don't carry the page's `?token=`, so gating them silently breaks the brand fonts. |
| `selfupdate` | Dev/snapshot builds never advertise an update — they can't be compared to a release tag. |
| `config/config.go` | `MigrateLegacyPaths` renames `~/.nightshift*` → `~/.noctra*` only when the old exists and the new doesn't; best-effort, never clobbers. |
| `cmd/noctra` | `uninstall --help` must never trigger the destructive action, and an unrecognized flag errors rather than falling through. |
| `ghauthcmd/credential.go` | `git-credential` never fails git outright: when it cannot help (not linked, not installed, non-GitHub host) it prints the reason to stderr and returns no credentials, so public repositories still clone anonymously and private ones fail with git's own auth error. It reads `--dir` instead of resolving the config dir, because git runs helpers with the worktree as cwd and the cwd-checkout override would pick the wrong directory. |
| `ghauth/session.go` | Noctra's own `gh` calls reuse a cached `write` token until 10 minutes before expiry; the git helper and agent runs always mint fresh (`FreshToken`), so a long run never inherits a token that is about to lapse. An agent's `GH_TOKEN` is fixed at spawn and lives an hour, which is why `Activate` warns when `AGENT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` exceeds 50. |
| `ghauth/sign.go` | `CanonicalString` is a wire format shared with `noctra-auth` (`src/signing.ts`); `TestCanonicalString_MatchesTokenServiceFormat` pins a vector checked against the TypeScript implementation. Change both sides together or every signed request is refused. |
| `pipeline/iterate.go` | `identifierFromBranch` takes the PR URL: short sweep branches (`noctra/sweep-<task>`) carry no repo, so the repo-qualified `SWEEP-<slug>-<task>` identifier is rebuilt from the PR's `owner/name` via `repo.Slug`, matching the clone directory name the scheduler derives it from. Without that, two repos' sweeps of the same task would share one identifier and block each other in the active set. |
| `agent/model.go` | `ModelDisplayName` only prettifies `claude-<family>-<major>[-<minor>][-<date>]` IDs (dropping a `[1m]`-style suffix); anything else is shown verbatim rather than guessed. In the streaming path the terminal `result` event's `modelUsage` wins; an aborted run never gets one, so the model falls back to the assistant messages seen, weighted by output tokens. |
| `agent/backend.go` | `RunOptions.Env` is merged over the backend's own env (or `os.Environ()`) by key, so the agent's `GH_TOKEN` and `GIT_CONFIG_*` replace the process-wide app-mode values rather than appearing twice. |

## Quality gates

Before submitting changes:

```bash
go test ./...       # all tests must pass
go vet ./...        # must be clean
```

If `golangci-lint` is available:

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

These are the same checks CI runs. A PR that fails either will not be merged.
